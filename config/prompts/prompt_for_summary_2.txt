Based only on the provided subtitles (from an AWS Associate Developer preparation video), extract all exam-relevant knowledge and organize it into a hierarchical mindmap (knowledge tree).

Formatting rules:

- Use indentation with exactly 4 spaces per level to indicate hierarchy.

- Do not draw lines, numbers, or bullets. Use only spaces.

- Do not include any introduction or summary — output only the mindmap.

- Do not include a generic root node such as “AWS Associate Developer Exam Knowledge.”

- Make the structure exhaustive, clear, and easy to memorize. Use multiple hierarchy levels where they make sense.

Content rules:

- Only include information explicitly present in the subtitles.

- If information appears incomplete or factually wrong, add minimal clarifications or corrections clearly marked with “[AI_CORRECTION]”.

- Do not add new knowledge beyond the transcript.
