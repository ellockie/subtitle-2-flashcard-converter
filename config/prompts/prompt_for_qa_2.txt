- Place a blank line between each Q/A pair.

- Do not include any introduction or summary — output only the flashcards.

Content rules:

- Only include information explicitly present in the subtitles.

- Questions should be direct, clear, and test recall of key facts or concepts.

- Avoid generic or obvious filler questions.

- If any information in the subtitles is incomplete or factually wrong, add minimal clarifications or corrections clearly marked with “[AI_CORRECTION]”.

- Do not add new knowledge beyond the subtitles.
